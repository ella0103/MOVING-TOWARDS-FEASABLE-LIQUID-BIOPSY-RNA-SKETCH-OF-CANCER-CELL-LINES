# MOVING-TOWARDS-FEASABLE-LIQUID-BIOPSY-RNA-SKETCH-OF-CANCER-CELL-LINES
Analysis of cancer and healthy cell lines using long-read RNA-seq, conducted with the ONT MinION device.

The objective of the study was set to assess the feasibility of RNA sketching with MinION for efficient differentiation between liquid biopsy samples of cancer cell lines and healthy cell lines.
