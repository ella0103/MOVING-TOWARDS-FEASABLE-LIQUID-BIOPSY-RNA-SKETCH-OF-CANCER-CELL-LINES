# MOVING-TOWARDS-FEASABLE-LIQUID-BIOPSY-RNA-SKETCH-OF-CANCER-CELL-LINES
Analysis of cancer and healthy cell lines using long-read RNA-seq, conducted with the ONT MinION device.

The objective of the study was set to assess the feasibility of RNA sketching with MinION for efficient differentiation between liquid biopsy samples of cancer cell lines and healthy cell lines.

## Galaxy Workflow
The Galaxy Workflow can be accessed [here](https://github.com/ella0103/MOVING-TOWARDS-FEASABLE-LIQUID-BIOPSY-RNA-SKETCH-OF-CANCER-CELL-LINES/blob/a939c148217ea633a306f9f73b5260881cd6e752/Galaxy-Workflow-Workflow_constructed_from_history__MinION_data_imported_%20(2).ga).

## Input files 
Input files can be accessed on the [Galaxy history] (https://galaxy.atgm.avans.nl/u/mirela_minkova/h/minion-rna-seq-input-data)

## Reference genome
The reference sample, T2T-CHM13v2.0 was downloaded locally from the [official site of the National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_009914755.1/). 
The files can be accessed in the local history in a fna and gtf file format [here] (https://galaxy.atgm.avans.nl/u/mirela_minkova/h/reference-genome)  

## Tools and settings
All tools were used directly on the Galaxy server provided by Avans University of Applied Sciences.
